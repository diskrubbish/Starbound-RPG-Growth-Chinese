      "Chs": "这些以太很像相位物质，尽管看起来你可以使它变得更强。 我已经为你释放了一些你现有的以太，但是你现在也可以释放它。去找一处铁砧去锻造你的天拓·以太，这样你就可以用其去刺穿敌人。",
      "Eng": "This Ether is quite like Phase Matter, though it seems that you can harden it. I have already tempered some of your current Ether for you, but you can now do so as well. Go build the Aether in an anvil so you can pierce through enemies."
