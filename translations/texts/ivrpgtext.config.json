Now!\" She didn't have to yell twice as their formation tightened before her sentence had even finished. 20 meters. Her shield held steady, and her fingers wrapped tightly around the pistol in her hand. There would only be a few seconds, but she would make those seconds count. 1 meter. A screeching sound rang as the bolt slammed against metal, nearly breaking their guard. Nearly. But a Titan's shield, albeit lighter than a Paladin's, wasn't just for show. The blast deflected, slamming the ground with a force that staggered the two besides her. But without a word, her hand moved from defensive to offensive, and as the shots rang out, victory was decided."

Almost immediately, she knew where it was and what it was, and before it had even ended, a quiet 'thwip' erased it... Another meal.\n\nBeneath the murky clouds, she took residence in a nearby delapidated bunker: essentially ruins at this point. But it gave her cover from the howling winds, pounding rain into the metal. She heard every drop. Flames lighting up the darkness, with occasional flashes from lightning outside, she cooked the beast, salivating. Another night.\n\nMorning came and she woke calmly, nudged gently by someone familiar. Normally, she would have noticed a presence much sooner, knife brandished, but with the Floran in front of her, it was rather difficult. The Floran smirked, before offering up a canteen. The nectarine water relieved her parched throat. Another morning.\n\nThe two continued along a tangled path, relying on her ears and eyes for guidance. Approaching the unknown entrance, they stopped to investigate - and summarily dismantle - the various contraptions meant to brutally dismember intruders. With the two of them quite astute and dextrous, it was child's play. The Ancient Tomb now exposed forever, the two searched inside, longing for an answer. Despite the Floran's perfect translations, the text was seemingly nonsensical, but not quite. Another clue.\n\nNow back in vicious wilderness, the two took shelter once more. Despite the situation, the Floran's hand grazed her neck. \"Will you help me recharge?\" The Floran teased: her actions set the context. \"Ha!\" The Hunter giggled. \"That's just like you. All alone for only three days and you're already like this.\" Even so, she reciprocated: Hunter or not, a little levity never hurt. Another day... a peaceful day."

She picked up an arrow lodged in the ground, one that had sliced clean through her prey; of course, of course: she never missed... Her Bow hummed as it scanned the ammunition, a mist of liquid spraying from the bottom canister. These weren't normal arrows, and definitely not an average bow, but she was no ordinary predator.\n\nPlacing the now cleansed arrow in her quiver, she quickly searched for any other enemies as the smoke behind her dissipated, showing only red remains. She wasn't psychopathic, but rather ^red;efficient^reset;, and with each new target killed, her worries shrank. Her ears picked up a sound that only an animal would hear, and so she took off, deftly weaving through thickets of spiny branches. Despite her rapid movement, she barely made a sound as she approached what she could only assume was an enemy camp. Sure enough, she found a camp occupied by several soldiers.\n\nShe crouched: time to get to it. Drawing the string, a radiant magenta emanated from within her, spreading throughout the components of her bow and slowly enveloping her body. But before the light could shine bright enough to alert the guards of her presence, she released. The arrow flew true, landing dead center of the encampment, embedding within a wooden post before imploding. She smirked, brandishing her dagger and vanishing from sight.\n\nNear or Far; Quick or Flashy; Wrong or Right...\n^green;Ha! Didn't matter to a Hunter."

Perhaps it was better this way.\n\nShe stared. Nothing stared back. It was strange, this 'nothingness', because 'nothingness' didn't exist: it couldn't, because even nothing was something. How ridiculous...\n\nShe listened as the words Egoen spoke reflected in the spaces between. She reciprocated, pointlessly, slowly edging her fingertips around the kunai strapped to her thigh. She knew he would not choose to depart, clutching on to life fruitlessly, spitting words of power at the emptiness surrounding: cursing this reality for snatching Zia from his grasp. So she would choose for him. There was no blood: there could not be; even so, he died. Glad, at first, her emotions turned sour: without a doubt, this was the only way. She knew it as such; the nothingness told her - not through whispers, not through images, not through thoughts, but through reality. The endless-featureless-emptiness was existence: the only definite, the only absolute, the only truth. Despite this, she could not help but feel overwhelmed as his soul escaped and only hers remained: ensnared, forever. The moment was gone: he had taken it from her, not via his own actions, but by hers. She panicked, as there was nearly nothing left for her to do.\n\nSoliste, she cried. Soliste! Was she waiting? Would she ever know? The nothing encroached and squeezed tightly, despite pulling her apart. Soliste: that was all she could think about, 'laughing' incredulously until there was nothing left to think.\n\nAnd just like that, she was nothing too."

No, because there was no death. Not with what they had found. She was the third one. Of course she was: because her master had been there all along, wielding magic greater than comprehension.

To be brought back because that man could not accept failure. Ridiculous. Ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. And just as he could not accept her 'death', she did not accept her 'return'.
