How ridiculous...\n\nShe listened as the words Egoen spoke reflected in the spaces between. She reciprocated, pointlessly, slowly edging her fingertips around the kunai strapped to her thigh. She knew he would not choose to depart, clutching on to life fruitlessly, spitting words of power at the emptiness surrounding: cursing this reality for snatching Zia from his grasp. So she would choose for him. There was no blood: there could not be; even so, he died. Glad, at first, her emotions turned sour: without a doubt, this was the only way. She knew it as such; the nothingness told her - not through whispers, not through images, not through thoughts, but through reality. The endless-featureless-emptiness was existence: the only definite, the only absolute, the only truth. Despite this, she could not help but feel overwhelmed as his soul escaped and only hers remained: ensnared, forever. The moment was gone: he had taken it from her, not via his own actions, but by hers. She panicked, as there was nearly nothing left for her to do.\n\nSoliste, she cried. Soliste! Was she waiting?
